		<p>
		With 13 years in the industry, Nathalie Bibeau has traveled the world in service of award-winning documentaries.  A story lover from the start, she found a mentor at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who brought her into the fold of the groundbreaking series, <i>Canada: A People’s History</i>. During her career at the in-house production unit of the CBC, she went on to produce acclaimed series such as <i>8th Fire</i>, nominated for the Canadian Screen Awards, and <i>Africa on the Move</i>, which won the Gemini for Best Documentary Series in 2011.
		</p>
		<p>
		Her work as a producer and field director has taken her everywhere from the sub-Arctic to Angola and the swamps of Louisiana. She has written for the Globe and Mail, hosted the Peter Gerretsen Awards at Ryerson University, and volunteered for War Child in Ethiopia. She holds a B.A. from McGill University and an M.A. in Russian History from the University of Toronto - and she’s fluent in Swedish, of all things.
		</p>
		<p>
		Her latest project is a feature documentary (Hot Docs 2015) and digital media project, working with Michèle Hozer and Janice Dawe at The Cutting Factory, in association with TVO.
